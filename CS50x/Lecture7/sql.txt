.import favorites.csv favorites

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM favorites WHERE language = 'C'

SELECT * FROM shows WHERE id IN
(SELECT show_id FROM ratings WHERE rating >= 6.0);

SELECT title,rating FROM shows JOIN ratings ON shows.id = ratings.show_id WHERE rating >=6.0 LIMIT 10;

one-to-many relationship will have duplication in table

Nested query example (Hint: work backwards from what you know and go where you want to go):
SELECT name FROM people WHERE id IN =
(SELECT person_id FROM stars WHERE show_id =
(SELECT id FROM shows WHERE title = 'The Office' AND year = 2005));

Nested query example 2:
SELECT title FROM shows WHERE id IN
(SELECT show_id FROM stars WHERE person_id =
(SELECT id FROM people WHERE name = 'Steve Carrell'));

Joining multiple tables:
SELECT title FROM shows
JOIN stars on shows.id = stars.show_id
JOIN people ON stars.person_id = people.id
WHERE name = 'Steve Carell';
